# ITN De-prioritization Algorithm for Malaria Control in Ilorin, Nigeria

## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for the algorithm used to guide the targeted de-prioritization of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) in urban areas of Ilorin, Nigeria. This initiative, a collaboration between the World Health Organization (WHO) and the National Malaria Elimination Programme (NMEP), aims to tailor malaria interventions and optimize resource allocation based on local malaria transmission patterns and resource availability.

## Background
In the context of varying malaria transmission patterns and resource scarcity, a one-size-fits-all strategy is ineffective. Therefore, a mixed-methods approach was employed to identify communities in Ilorin where ITN distribution could be scaled back. This approach integrates quantitative analysis with local insights and field evaluations, ensuring a strategic framework for ITN de-prioritization and a judicious allocation of interventions.

## Repository Structure
- `/algorithm`: contains the code for the secondary data analysis used to score and rank wards by malaria risk.
- `/documentation`: detailed documentation of the algorithm, including methodology and evaluation criteria.
- `/field_assessment`: data and findings from the field assessments conducted in selected wards.
- `/stakeholder_dialogue`: analyses from the Multistakeholder Dialogue (MSD) sessions.

## Methodology
1. **Secondary Data Analysis**: The algorithm starts with an analysis of secondary data to score and rank wards according to their malaria risk.
2. **Multistakeholder Dialogue (MSD)**: The MSD validates the algorithmic findings and collaboratively identifies potential wards for ITN de-prioritization.
3. **Field Assessment**: A comprehensive field assessment in selected wards, focusing on settlement type heterogeneities to inform final decisions.

## Key Findings
The MSD corroborated the algorithmic findings, highlighting Are 2 and Akanbi 4 as potential wards for ITN de-prioritization.
Field visits to 188 settlements across both wards led to the decision to focus on Are 2. Out of 73 settlements assessed here, thirteen were earmarked for ITN scale-back.

## Impact
This mixed-methods approach provides a strategic framework for optimizing ITN de-prioritization in urban settings. It sets a precedent for addressing complex health issues through collaborative, evidence-based strategies.
